During her first appearance at a press conference since the surfacing of the sex photo scandal, Hong Kong actress Gillian Chung put on a brave face and forced a smile but did not shed any tears, which met with overwhelmingly negative reactions from the media and the public, blaming the actress for feeling no remorse.
 
_Very Salt, and Bitter, and Good_ is a recreation of the video work _0.7% Salt_. The original was made a year after the scandal by artist Jiang Zhi, showing Gillian performing the emotional transition from smiling to breaking down in tears. In _Very Salt, and Bitter, and Good_, computer vision algorithms track the viewer in real-time, the video continues only when the viewer's facial expression matches Gillian's.
